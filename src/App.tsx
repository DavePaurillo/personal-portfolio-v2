						as a Software Engineer. I was deployed in Google @
						Android Enterprise where I started to create an impact
						by creating in-house apps that helped my team be
						efficient in our day to day tasks. In Accenture, I was
						able to hone my leadership skills as I was tasked to
						handle a small team.

						I left Accenture after 5 years to focus on my health and
						to regain myself. As I continue my lifelong journey as a
						developer, all I want to do is build websites. I want to
						be able to always give my 100% because it gives me great
						joy and pleasure when I see people using and admiring my
						work.
					</p>

					<p>
						I'm currently looking for a full remote work. I'm also
						open for relocation w/ visa sponsorship and assistance.
